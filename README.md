# Anti-Nuke Discord Bot



## Overview

This project is an anti-nuke Discord bot(base*) designed to help server moderators detect and mitigate abusive behavior, spam, and other forms of malicious activity on their Discord servers. The bot provides various features and functionalities to monitor server activity, filter messages, and enforce server rules.

## Features you can implement

- **Message Filtering**: Detect and flag messages containing offensive language, spam, or other inappropriate content.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Track user activity, message frequency, and joining/leaving patterns to identify suspicious behavior.
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforce rate limits on message sending, user joins, or other actions to prevent spamming and abuse.
- **Automated Moderation**: Automatically mute, kick, or ban users who violate server rules or engage in abusive behavior.
- **Command Handling**: Implement commands to allow moderators to take manual actions, such as muting or banning users, with appropriate permissions and logging.
- **Log Management**: Keep detailed logs of moderation actions, user activity, and detected abuse for auditing purposes.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Send alerts or notifications to server moderators/administrators when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Integration with External Services**: Integrate with external services or APIs for additional threat detection capabilities, such as spam lists or IP blacklists.
- **Customization and Configuration**: Provide configuration options to customize bot behavior, such as adjustable filters, moderation actions, and alert thresholds.
